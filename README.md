Transaction and User Data Analysis Report
Overview
This report presents an analysis of multiple datasets focused on transaction and user metrics. The study covers various levels of aggregation, including state-level and district-level data, and incorporates demographic details alongside transaction specifics. The datasets include:
1.	State_Txn and Users: Contains overall transaction information, transaction amounts, and user-related metrics aggregated at the state level.
2.	State_TxnSplit: Provides a detailed breakdown of transactions by type.
3.	State_DeviceData: Offers statistics related to device usage.
4.	District_Txn and Users: Contains transaction and user data aggregated at the district level.
5.	District Demographics: Supplies demographic details for each district.
Key Observations from the State_Txn and Users Data
•	Dataset Size and Period: The dataset comprises 504 rows of data spanning from Q1 2018 to Q2 2021. It includes key metrics such as the number of transactions, the amount transacted (in INR), average transaction value (ATV), the number of registered users, and the number of app opens.
•	Data Quality Issues:
o	There is one missing value in the "Amount (INR)" column.
o	App Opens data is largely missing, represented by zero entries, which possibly indicates difficulties in capturing this metric accurately.
Transaction Trends Over Time
•	Steady Growth: Throughout the period, there is a noticeable steady growth in transactions starting from Q2 2020. This trend is attributed to a significant shift toward cashless payments following the Covid-19 pandemic.
•	Data Gaps: The missing value in the "Amount (INR)" column remains consistent, reinforcing the need for careful consideration when performing trend analyses.
Insights from the State-Level Analysis
Top States by Transactions
Analysis indicates that states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu lead in transaction volume. This domination is likely driven by the higher population density and a greater technological penetration resulting from higher literacy rates.
Registered User Growth Trends
•	Pre-Covid Era: A gradual increase in user adoption was noted, driven by initiatives like digitization and demonetization efforts.
•	During Covid Era: The adoption rate saw a rapid increase, reflecting an accelerated shift toward the use of digital financial services during the pandemic period.  
Transaction Type Distribution
•	Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions: This remains the most prevalent type of transaction across various states.  
•	Recharge & Bill Payments: These transactions closely follow P2P in their frequency and are a key component of the overall transaction mix.
•	Merchant Payments: In certain states, such as Delhi and Goa, merchant payments are rapidly growing and, in some instances, have even surpassed P2P transactions, highlighting emerging market segments.
Conclusion
This analysis provides comprehensive insights into how digital transactions and user behavior have evolved over time and across regions. The results highlight the importance of addressing data quality issues, such as missing values, and underscore the significant impact of external factors like the Covid-19 pandemic on the shift toward cashless transactions. The insights gained from examining top-performing states, user growth patterns, and the distribution of transaction types can inform further strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing digital financial services and policy-making.
